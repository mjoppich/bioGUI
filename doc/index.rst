********************
bioGUI documentation
********************

Bioinformatics is a highly interdisciplinary field providing tools for researchers from many disciplines.
Nonetheless, most methods are implemented with a command line Interface only.

Using *bioGUI*, former command line-only tools can be started from a GUI, making them available to a broader scientific community.

If you are a **user**, it is recommended to start reading directly from :ref:`biogui_introduction`.
Please also read through the :ref:`user_guide`. 
We also provide a video tutorial to demonstrate how to install a module with an *install module* and use this module/tool afterwards in :ref:`video_tutorial`.

If you are a (bioinformatics) tools **developer** and want to learn how to build (install) templates, start reading here: :ref:`bioGUI_working_mechanism`.

If the offered windows and execution nodes are not enough and you want to **extend** *bioGUI*, the *bioGUI* :ref:`biogui_developer_guide` may be of help for you.
